  <p> Hi! My name's Beau and I am an artist at LHS. The arts have always been a passion of mine, whether it be in an audial or visual form. I have invested countless hours of work into my artistic career, and am approaching 600 days of drawing in a row. This website catalogs some of my art up to April 2017. Enjoy! </p>  
  <h3> Here's a piece I did that has my friends in our favourite musical: </h3>

  <h3> Here's another one that I did, This one was for the school paper. It's about YouTube's restricted mode and how it blocked videos with LGBTQ+ Themes. </h3>

  <h3> This one shows my progression of art. The drawing in the bottom righthand corner was done in April of 2015, and the biggest image was done earlier in April of 2017. </h3>
